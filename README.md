Original texts:

In this section you will find various projects I've done. One common denominator about them is  they are all solely pc-based, meaning you'll be able to run them yourself on your own device. As I am a strong believer in the ethics of open-source software everything posted here you'll be able to follow and recreate should you wish to.  The projects shown here projects my programming interests which spans from data science and Machine learning, to creative coding and web development, and UX/UI Design projects. I also do physical computing, but this is allocated to a its own section.
