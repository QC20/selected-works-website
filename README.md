# Selected Works Website
I've crafted this personal website with invaluable guidance from Henry Hefferman's original work, which I then expanded and tailored to reflect my vision for a personal website. I aimed for a Windows 95/98 OS vibe reminiscent of having multiple windows open simultaneously, creating a bustling desktop atmosphere that immerses you in my universe. I hope you enjoy exploring it. If you're interested in my work, have constructive criticism to share, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out!

## How to setup this website locally

### To setup a dev environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/QC20/selected-works-website.git

# Install dependencies 
npm i

# Run the local dev server
npm run dev
```

### To serve a production build

```bash
# Install dependencies if not already done
npm i

# Build for production
npm run build

# Serve the build using express
npm start
```

### Things I need to improve:
- [ ] Insert micropolis game
- [ ] Figure out how to make projects open in different windows
- [ ] Make fill out form work (and send to your own fill-out form)
- [ ] Figure out how to deal with large files in the repo (currently it is fixed by having <50mb files)
- [ ] Switch out ThreeJS project on desktop with some other interesting and interactive web dev app you've made

## To-Do's
- Make reasearch paper images smaller in size so they'll be quicker to load in.
  - same goes for all the stuff used in the projects.
  - Make a GIF of the landing page instead of a still image. 
  - The carthesian thingy will not erase. Please fix. 
- Make a new favicon for the website

In this section you will find various projects I've done. One common denominator about them is  they are all solely pc-based, meaning you'll be able to run them yourself on your own device. As I am a strong believer in the ethics of open-source software everything posted here you'll be able to follow and recreate should you wish to.  The projects shown here projects my programming interests which spans from data science and Machine learning, to creative coding and web development, and UX/UI Design projects. I also do physical computing, but this is allocated to a its own section.
