# Selected Works Website
I've crafted this personal website with invaluable guidance from Henry Hefferman's original work, which I then expanded and tailored to reflect my vision for a personal website. I aimed for a vibe reminiscent of having multiple windows open simultaneously, creating a bustling desktop atmosphere that immerses you in my universe. I hope you enjoy exploring it. If you're interested in my work, have constructive criticism to share, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out!

In this section you will find various projects I've done. One common denominator about them is  they are all solely pc-based, meaning you'll be able to run them yourself on your own device. As I am a strong believer in the ethics of open-source software everything posted here you'll be able to follow and recreate should you wish to.  The projects shown here projects my programming interests which spans from data science and Machine learning, to creative coding and web development, and UX/UI Design projects. I also do physical computing, but this is allocated to a its own section.
