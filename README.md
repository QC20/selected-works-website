# Selected Works Website
I've crafted this personal website with invaluable guidance from Henry Hefferman's original work, which I then expanded and tailored to reflect my vision for a personal website. I aimed for a Windows 95/98 OS vibe reminiscent of having multiple windows open simultaneously, creating a bustling desktop atmosphere that immerses you in my universe. I hope you enjoy exploring it. If you're interested in my work, have constructive criticism to share, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out!

git clone https://github.com/QC20/selected-works-website.git

npm run dev
```

### To serve a production build

```bash

### Things I need to improve:
- [x] Insert abroad schools
- [ ] Insert micropolis game
- [ ] Learn how to make projects open in different windows
  - [x] Make project website appear in windows on desktop
- [x] insert projects pages
  - [x] insert creative projects
  - [x] insert music and art
  - [x] insert embedded projects 
- [ ] Make fill out form work
- [ ] Figure out how to deal with large files in the repo
- [x] Add reseaech paper section

## To-Do's
- Make reasearch paper images smaller in size so they'll be quicker to load in.
  - same goes for all the stuff used in the projects.
  - Make a GIF of the landing page instead of a still image. 
  - The carthesian thingy will not erase. Please fix. 



Original texts:

In this section you will find various projects I've done. One common denominator about them is  they are all solely pc-based, meaning you'll be able to run them yourself on your own device. As I am a strong believer in the ethics of open-source software everything posted here you'll be able to follow and recreate should you wish to.  The projects shown here projects my programming interests which spans from data science and Machine learning, to creative coding and web development, and UX/UI Design projects. I also do physical computing, but this is allocated to a its own section.
