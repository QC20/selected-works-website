                in having artistic outlets, whether they are analog or digital. I don't want to limit myself to any one canvas. This perspective has 
                inspired me to explore a variety of mediums. For instance, I deeply appreciate the tactile experience and rich color spectrum achievable 
                through oil painting, as well as the flexibility of the medium. I can leave my painting for three days, and when I resume working on it, 
                it's as if I was never away. {' '}

                Similarly, the computer screen presents itself as the canvas we might spend the most time looking at in our lives. Therefore, 
                experimenting with this medium is a natural progression, especially because it allows for entirely new ways of incorporating 
                interactive elements and exploring the realm of interaction design. {' '}

        I imagine this design can be used as a striking and expressive landing page for your website, with minimal text and only a few links to make the design stand out. 
        In my stripped-down example, I've included a small interactive button with a link to my LinkedIn profile to underline how you might include a very subtle redirect. 
        For a fun twist, swap the geometric shapes with bouncing SVGs or images to make your design pop!

                A more recent activity I've been picking up is oil painting. What really excites me about this endeavor is that I have no prior 
                experience whatsoever. Actually, growing up left-handed and with handwriting that was more or less intelligible, I guess I was 
                somewhat deterred from drawing, painting, or doing anything by hand.{' '}
            <br /><br></br>

                However, in 2021, I started to pick up my first supplies and first clean canvas. Having no idea what I was doing or how to even begin 
                learning, I decided to just throw myself into it and hope something beautiful would spawn out of it. Moreover, I think it was a deliberate 
                decision of mine to not seek any type of help or teaching about techniques or styles. The reason for this was purely based on the idea 
                that I wanted to see what I would be able to create purely based on my own intuition and creativity.{' '}
      
            <br /> <br></br>

        What excites and inspires me when conceptualizing a new canvas is starting from an initial feeling, exploring uncharted techniques, experimenting 
        with new texture designs, or using paint products I havenâ€™t tried before. I persist until something I like emerges, and then I continue from there. 
        Overall, a significant takeaway from oil painting is the opportunity to refine and practice skills I initially lacked proficiency or experience in. {' '}
