                I have dedicated this section to my artistic endeavors, where I explore the realms of music, sound, and visual arts. I am deeply engrossed 
                in having artistic outlets, whether they are analog or digital. I don't want to limit myself to any one canvas. This perspective has 
                inspired me to explore a variety of mediums. For instance, I deeply appreciate the tactile experience and rich color spectrum achievable 
                through oil painting, as well as the flexibility of the medium. I can leave my painting for three days, and when I resume working on it, 
                it's as if I was never away. {' '}

                Similarly, the computer screen presents itself as the canvas we might spend the most time looking at in our lives. Therefore, 
                experimenting with this medium is a natural progression, especially because it allows for entirely new ways of incorporating 
                interactive elements and exploring the realm of interaction design. {' '}

                In this project, deliberate user input, like mouse interactions, merges with the dynamic influence of ambient light. It's about blending 
                control with environmental responsiveness, creating an interactive experience that blurs the line between user agency and natural influence. 
                While we start with mouse and light, the project encourages exploration:  reacting to gyroscopic changes, responding to variations in sound 
                intensity, or dynamically adapting to specific spoken words. These uncontrolled elements hold the potential to transform the user's journey, 
                opening doors to new realms of exploration and creativity.{' '}
