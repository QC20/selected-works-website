          Driven by a passion for improving the interface between humans and
          innovative technologies, I thrive across various domains within HCI,
          Computer Science, and Cognitive Science, while always keeping the
          user's needs and desires at the forefront of my work. Alright, I guess
          that covers the elevator pitch. Now, let's get real. I've designed
          this website in direct opposition to most contemporary design
          conventions because I believe it creates a more engaging user
          experience. While other sites rush to deliver everything within 5
          seconds and under 2 clicks, this site will reward those who are
          curious enough to explore.{" "}

        <h3>Getting to know me</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Let me give you a quick look into who I am. From my passions to my
          personal journey, I hope to give you a better sense of the person
          behind the screen. I'm driven by a constant desire for
          self-improvement. I feel most alive when I'm stepping into something
          completely new, where I'm a total beginner, and I can witness my own
          growth as I develop new skills and competencies. In most areas of my
          life, this is what drives me. This innate desire to create and build.
          I definitely have a 'creator gene' that constantly pushes me to make,
          tinker and experiment. But itâ€™s not just about creating; it has to
          have purpose. Whenever possible, it should serve as an improvement,
          spark a provocation, or offer a fresh perspective.{" "}

          When Iâ€™m not using the computer to create, I like to stay active and
          keep my body moving. I practice both yoga and karate. My philosophy is
          that you canâ€™t have yin without yang, and this applies to everything
          in life. In order to be a complete human being, you need to embrace
          and access both sides: the softness and flexibility of the yin, but
          also the strength to push and perservere through challenges and
          hardships when needed.

        <br />
        <p>
          To nourish my mind, I also participate in a weekly political debate
          club, where we discuss current events and explore classic texts to
          educate each other and gain a deeper understanding of the world around
          us. Beyond learning and helping others do the same, this also sharpens
          my argumentative and public speaking skills. You havenâ€™t truly
          defended your viewpoints until youâ€™ve debated someone with decades of
          experience. While I donâ€™t win every argument, I make sure to learn
          from my mistakes each time.

          And outside of the pure software domain, I have a range of projects
          and hobbies that I enjoy exploring in my spare time, allowing me to
          express my creativity and keep my mind engaged. Among the more
          tangible things I do, I tinker with{" "}

              My journey into the world of information technology started early.
              I remember spending countless hours on social sites, enhancing my
              bio with HTML coding. The ability to make screens interactive and
              visually engaging fascinated me, setting the stage for my passion
              for technology. Upon carrying out my Bachelors in{" "}

              , which is a pioneering initiative focused on fostering diversity
              and inclusion in technology. From here I was introduced to HCI and
              interaction design, discovering the intricate balance between
              technology and human needs. Exploring topics such as user
              experience, usability, and interface design, I became passionate
              about creating technology that enhances human capabilities and
              enriches lives. To further hone my technical skills and feed my
              interests, I pursued a M.Sc. in{" "}

              to empower me to develop advanced cognitive tehcbologies, enabling
              me to gain deep knowledge of language, vision, and cognition, to
              design innovative information and communication technology (ICT)
              that mimics human cognitive processes and addresses complex
              cognitive phenomena such as memory, attention, and language. As
              these systems increasingly rely on machine learning and AI, my
              objective is to refine these approaches and enhance user
              engagement. By enabling individuals to draw more actionable
              insights from these technologies, I aim to leverage my
